    <p class="block-text">Hello! I have been thinking hard about what my first post should be about, and I decided to write about how I built this site.<br>
<br>
The first time I built it, it was just a portfolio site. I designed it as I went, and never really did much with it once it was finished. So, after a few months, and a lot of improvement, I decided to redesign and rebuild it.<br>
<br>
I had just started messing around with Gravit Designer, so I used that to design the site. I worked out exactly how I wanted everything to look, and I had a lot of fun doing it! Needless to say, I have been messing around a lot more with designing things ðŸ˜…. When it was time to start building the site I didn't have to think about the design, and that was great. It gave me more time to think about the code. The site was done in a few days, just HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.<br>
<br>
At first, I planned on hard coding all of the blog posts, but the more I thought about it, the more I didn't want to do that. I began looking into static site generators and CMS's. Contentful is what I decided to use as a CMS, but none of the SSG's that I found seemed to be exactly what I needed, and I was stuck for a few days. As I was trying to find a solution, I asked myself if there were any way I could build a tool to generate the HTML the way I needed.<br>
<br>
After a little research into nodejs, I spent about a day trying to write a script that would: 1) generate the blog index that would list all of the blog posts, and 2) write the blog post files.<br>
<br>
It took me about a day to figure out the script completely, and I felt pretty accomplished!<br>
<br>
Now, after writing a blog post all I have to do is run the script, and push the project to GitHub. That's it! It was a fun project, and I am pretty proud of it now. In the future I may add a store for WordPress themes, and an email list, or other things of that sort, but for now it is done. Let me know if you liked it by shooting me an email or commenting wherever you found a link to it. Thank you for reading!</p>
