            I have known that I wanted to start a blog for awhile now, but I wasn’t sure how I wanted to do it. And I have had my portfolio site up for a few months, but I wasn’t doing anything with it. So I decided to redesign my site, mix it all together, and get going with it!

            I will be writing about things I am working on, and things that I am learning, along with how I am learning. Hopefully, I will be able to help someone.

            I built this site using plain HTML and CSS, and my blog posts will be manually coded. I used Gravit Designer, which is free, to design the entire site before I built it. It was a fun process, and I am pretty proud of it.
